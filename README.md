# Shawtastic_PizzaSales_mysql

This project explores sales and operational data from a fictional pizza business using SQL. By querying and analyzing multiple relational tables—including orders, order details, pizzas, and pizza types—I uncovered insights into best-selling pizzas, peak order times, revenue trends, and customer preferences. The goal is to demonstrate how raw transactional data can be transformed into meaningful business intelligence using only SQL.
